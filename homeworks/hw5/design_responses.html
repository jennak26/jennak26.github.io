                            <p> I learned about AI generated images and how powerful AI generated images are. I also learned how AI can be applied to web desgin and how it effects the use experience.

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of the article was all the AI generated images. I thought they were desgined super well and took a lot of inspiration from them. It helped me get ideas for future design projects. </p>

                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite inspiration was the smarai fox and the colorful end of the world scene. For the samuri fox, it was able to achive the the real life aspect but also combine it with fantasy. I feel this is the same for the atomic bomb scene but instead it is more fantasy that real life. Both were able to have a single asthetic that they stuck to for the whole picture. </p>
