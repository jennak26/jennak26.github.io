							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> 
								I learned about some soft rules when it comes to animation and how do draw viewers attention 
								bigger things using smaller and subtle animations.  It taught me how little decisions in how we 
								animate can change the animation completely and make transitions smoother or more clear. I also leanred 
								some science behind animations.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> 
								My favorite part of the article was how it made me aware of little things that I was not aware of before. 
								I was able to understand how to use css to make animaitons less choppy and more natural. I also liked the part 
								where they talked about how to use how to the animation timing fucntion and the different ease curves.

							<p> 
								So, if we sum up all of the above-mentioned rules and principles, the animation 
								in the interface should reflect the movements that we know from the physical world â€” friction, 
								acceleration, etc. Imitating the behavior of objects from the real world we can create a sequence 
								that allows users to understand what to expect from the interface.
