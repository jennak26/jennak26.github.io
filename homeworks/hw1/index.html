    <p> Hi! My name is Jenna. I am from the Bay Area and have lived there for most of my life. In my free time I like watching tv, eating food, and listening to music. I also work on campus as a Community Service Officer and give Bearwalks to people at night. If you see me on campus working feel free to flag me down. :)</p>

    <ul> 
        <li> I leanred each design feature of an app or website is intentional. I have learned how to question and indentify design choices and how it effects me as a consumer. </li>
        <li> My favorite part of the article was how they animated the things that we focus on and the order that we focus on. The animation helped me notice the less obvioius design choices and question the smaller details. </li>
        <li> "The placeholder text in the search bar could have just said “Search here” but instead they mention a specific city. Though I have no intention of going to London, seeing the possibility of it is exciting." </li>
        <li> 10, I really liked this article because even though it was short, the message was impactful to show the impotance of web and app design. It showed me how little things can make a big impact. </li>
