            <p> 
                We continue to seek out the best sausage from the best sausage-makers who, 
                born to a tradition of taste, we believe, tend to serve it better.
                We remain evermore on the prrrowl for unique sausages for affordable and 
                convenient hot dog enjoyment.

                Top dog grew out of a boy's love of sausage, a staple in his German immigrants' New York home over the WWII years. 
                Steaks? Tubesteaks! His paper route to a well-mixed neighborhood assured that Italian, Polish, even Hungarian 
                sausages were soon no strangers to that developing appetite and palate. Nor had he far to go to a cart or stand 
                offering kosher style "Franks", usually steeped but better off the griddle.
